Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

1) a and b do not overlap each other.
2) a and b overlaps b ends after a.
3) a and b overlaps a ends after a.
4) a completely overlaps b.
5) b completely overlaps a.
6) a and b do not overlap.
